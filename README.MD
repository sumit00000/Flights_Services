This is a base node js project template, which anyone can use as it has been prepared, by keeping some of the most important code principles and projects management recommendations, Feel free to change anything.

`src` -> inside the src folder all the actual source code regarding the project will reside, this will not include any kind of tests.(you might want to make seperate tests folder)

Lets take a look inside the `src` folder

- `config` --> in this folder anything and everything regarding any configurations of setup of a library or module will be done. For example: setting up `dotenv` so that we can use the environment variables anywhere in a cleaner fashion, this is done in the `server-config.js`.One more example can be to setup you logging library taht can help you to prepare meaningful logs, so configuration for this library should also be done here.

- `routes` --> In the routes folder, we register a route and the corresponding middleware and controllers to it. 

- `middlewares` --> they are just going to intercept the incoming requests where we can write our validators, authenticators etc.

- `controllers` --> they are kind of the last middlewares as post them you call you business layer to execute the business logic, In controllers we just receive the incoming requests and data then pass it to the business layer, and once business layer returns an output, we structure the API response in controllers and send  the output.

- `repository` --> this folder contains all the logiic using which we intract the DB by writing queries, all the raw queries or ORM queries will go here.

-  `services` --> contains the businss logic and intracts with repositories for data from database.

- `utils` --> contains for helper methods, error classes etc.



npx sequalize init


- Inside the `src/config` folder create a file named as `config.json` and write the following code:
```
  {
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_production",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```
or 
-- go inside the `src` folder and execute the following command:
```
    npx sequelize init
```
-- By executing the above command we will get migrations and seeders foler along with a config.json inside the config folder.

- if you are setting up your development environment, then write the name of your username of  your db, password of your db and in dialect mention whatever db you are using for ex. mysql, mariadb etc
 - if you are setting up test or prod environment, make sure you also replace the host with the hosted db url.
